#### App: Google Docs
-The ability to an entire group to utilize this app and work on the same Docs at the same time 
is a very big feature for me.
#### App: Discord
-Same as google docs, discord has a great usable feature for group activity as in being able to share work
and everyone gets the same updates at the same time making the usable feature for group work excellent.
